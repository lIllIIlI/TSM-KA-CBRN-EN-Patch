    <tsm.arsrw>I saw a new mission on the bounty board, so I came to see if there's anything I can complete.</tsm.arsrw>
    <tsm.other>Hello, someone told me there's a particularly tricky mission right now. I'd like to hear about it.</tsm.other>

    <tsm_srm_text.thanks2>“It's fine, it's healed a long time ago...” Qiu Wu wanted to say more, but her pager suddenly rang. She smiled and shook her head, saying, "I was thinking of how to thank you, but it seems I don’t have time now. I have to go." After saying this, Qiu Wu ran towards a soldier from Sea of Miracles waving at her in the distance. Halfway through, she turned around and shouted, "Next time! Next time we meet, I'll treat you to a meal!" She disappeared around the corner shortly after.</tsm_srm_text.thanks2>
